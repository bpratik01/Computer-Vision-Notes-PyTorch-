## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my notes and code implementations as I learn about Computer Vision. The notes cover key concepts, algorithms, and techniques in Computer Vision, while the code examples demonstrate how to implement these concepts using PyTorch.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository and explore the various notebooks and code files. Each notebook covers a specific topic in Computer Vision and includes explanations and code examples.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bpratik01/Computer-Vision-Notes-PyTorch-.git
   cd Computer-Vision-Notes-PyTorch-
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebooks to read the notes and run the code examples. You can start the Jupyter Notebook server with the following command:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the desired notebook and open it to see the content and run the code cells.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or new notes/code to add, please create a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
